## Molly Felder's website
Welcome to Molly Felder's author site.  Molly Felder is a published children's book author.  She came to me wanting a site to promote her books plus whatever future books she writes.

I decided to use laravel and mysql database to build her site. Her website will allow her to register.  Once that is completed, she will be be able to access the backend of the site.  There she has full CRUD capability for a database title for books (where all her books she published will be stored) and for events (where all her book signing events will be stored).  I used Laravel for both front and backend.  It is connected to a MySQL database.
