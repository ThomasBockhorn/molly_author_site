                    </h1>

                    <p class="lead"><i>Henry the Boy</i> is my debut picture book about a boy who sees himself differently than some kids at school see him—even his best friend, Joel!</p>

                    <p class="mb-3 mt-4">Henry walks with forearm crutches covered in animal stickers. At first, he loves the way the crutches make him feel. When that changes, he takes comfort in friendship and in Joel’s gift to him.
